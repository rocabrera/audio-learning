Phase is important to hearing because the effect of adding two sounds 
together depends on their relative phase.

The amplitude, or pressure, of a sound wave produced by a loudspeaker is
proportional to the velocity of the speaker cone.


Although pressure is a useful measure, it is also common in acoustics to refer
to the intensity of a sound wave. Intensity is defined as the sound energy passing
through a unit area (e.g., a square meter of air) every second. Power is defined
simply as the energy transmitted per second.


loudness (i.e., perceived magnitude)

Now the range of numbers we have to deal with when describing sounds is 
reduced from a factor of about 1,000,000,000,000 (in units of intensity) to a range from about
0 to 120 dB SPL.


The phase spectrum of a sound is the distribution of the phases 
(temporal alignments) of the pure-tone components that make up
the sound.



The short-term spectrum at a given time is produced by performing
a Fourier analysis of a short duration of the waveform centered on that time. The
analysis “window” usually applies a weighting so that the waveform near the
edges of the window is attenuated relative to the center.
